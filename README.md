# Hello, I am Stella.

Working with backend software, and websites.

\- Interested in machine learning and theoretical CS

\- Projects I want to work on
* Maybe my own version of a social media?
* Mocha (Programming Language)
* Try to make a Jyupiter notebook thing for Js / Ts

and more to come!

Mostly still working with just typescript and javascript, although I am slowly moving over to rust.
