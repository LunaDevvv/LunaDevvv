# Hello, I am Shiro.
Working with backend software, and websites.

\- Interested in machine learning and theoretical CS

\- Projects I want to work on
* Revamp website (Again)
* Maybe my own version of a social media?
* My own version of pronouns.page
* Remake my [carrd](https://plausiblyshiro.carrd.co/) manually.
* Mocha (Programming Language)
* Try to make a Jyupiter notebook thing for Js / Ts
* Make a picrew knockoff?

and more to come!

Mostly still working with just typescript and javascript, although I am slowly moving over to rust.

Obviously my plans for 2023 fell through, I didn't really have motivation or ideas.
Hopefully with these, I can do it in 2024!

Trying again for the daily commit.

ALSO my commits are broken? Sometimes I'll make a commit and github wont mark it in the commit thing. Its not totally accurate.
